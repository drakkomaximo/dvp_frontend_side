# Dvp_frontend_side
This is a frontend side for dvp test fullstack.

Steps to use the application:

1) Download the repository to your local machine using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/drakkomaximo/dvp_frontend_side.git
```
3) Use the following command to rebuild the `node_modules` folder:
```
yarn
```
4) Start the application from scratch with:
```
yarn run dev
```
5) You should create the .env file using the .env.template file as a template. Set the environment variable:
```

```
6) If the application is downloaded correctly, you should see it running on [localhost](http://localhost:5173/):
